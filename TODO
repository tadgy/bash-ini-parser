  -s <list>, --section=<list>Only parse the specified section(s).  List multiple
                             sections seperated by commas.  For the global section
                             use '.'.  For every section except global, use '*'.
                             For every section including the global section, don't
                             use this option (or use '.,*').

  --ignore-errors            Ignore parse errors in the ini file and continue
                             processing.  This will cause options to be ignored
                             and whole sections to be skipped if errors are found.
                             This option should not be used except for debugging.
