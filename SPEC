General file format
-------------------
* Blank lines are ignored.
* Lines starting with # and ; (configurable), after leading whitespace removal, are treated as comments.
    - Comments must appear on their own line.
Values can optionally be bookmarked with single or double quotes.
  - If quotes are to be used, they must be the first and last characters of the value
  - Occurances of the bookending quotes to be used within the value must be \ escaped.					???
  - Whitespace within the quotes is retained verbatim.
  - Backslash line continuation is supported within quotes (but leading whitespace on subsequent lines is removed).
Values can be continued by use of \ in the last column.
  - Subsequent lines are subject to leading whitespace removal as normal.
  - Comments are not recognised on subsequent lines - they are treated as part of the value.
Escaping of shell special characters is not required.									???


[section] format
----------------
* Section names must only be comprised of alphanumeric characters, plus _.-+
* The .-+ characters in section names will be converted to _
* Section names are case sensitive (unless --ignore-case? is used), so 'Foo' and 'foo' are different sections.
* Whitespace is ignored before and after the section name.


Booleans
--------
* no_<option> sets it to 0/false, else 1/true.
* Later settings of the same key override previous ones - last one wins.
