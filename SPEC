Blank lines are ignored.
Lines starting with # and ; (configurable; after leading whitespace removal) are treated as comments.
  - Comments must appear on their own line.
Values can optionally be bookmarked with single or double quotes.
  - If quotes are to be used, they must be the first and last characters of the value
  - Occurances of the bookending quotes to be used within the value must be \ escaped.					???
  - Whitespace within the quotes is retained verbatim.
  - Backslash line continuation is supported within quotes (but leading whitespace on subsequent lines is removed).
Values can be continued by use of \ in the last column.
  - Subsequent lines are subject to leading whitespace removal as normal.
  - Comments are not recognised on subsequent lines - they are treated as part of the value.
Escaping of shell special characters is not required.									???
